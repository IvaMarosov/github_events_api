## API Documentation

This project uses Swagger UI for API documentation.
The Swagger UI provides an interactive interface to explore and test the API endpoints.

To access the documentation you can:

1. Run the FastAPI application
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` 
or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` (assuming you didn't change the host and port where 
the application runs).

You can also check OpenAPI v3 API documentation in [YAML](docs/openapi.yaml) and [JSON](docs/openapi.json) file format.
